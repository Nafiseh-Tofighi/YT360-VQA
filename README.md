# YT360-VQA


We have introduced the **YT360-VQA** dataset, a large-scale dataset of of user-generated 360-degree videos designed for assessing 360-degree video quality. This dataset is significant as it includes authentic distortions and ambisonics audio, making it a valuable resource for audio-visual analysis of omnidirectional videos. All 100 videos in the dataset are sourced from YouTube and have been evaluated by individuals to collect subjective quality scores. By incorporating videos with ambisonic audio, our dataset allows for exploration of the impact of audio on the assessment of 360-degree video quality perception. These videos cover a diverse range of authentic distortions, spatial intricacies, and temporal complexities, providing researchers with rich material for analysis.
